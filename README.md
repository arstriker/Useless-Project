## Basic Details
### Team Name: Crazz


### Team Members

- Member 2: Arohan AR - Vidya Academy of Science and Technology

### Project Description
Ever wonder if your chai is truly up to snuff? The Chai-o-meter is a web app that uses AI to analyze your tea and deliver a brutally honest, sarcastic critique. It's the ultimate judge for discerning drinkers, ready to shame a lackluster brew or offer a rare moment of praise.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In the absence of a brutally honest tea connoisseur, how can individuals get instant, entertaining, and critical feedback on the quality of their brew?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We're solving this crucial, world-changing problem by forcing a powerful AI to become your personal, brutally honest tea critic. Our AI-powered web app takes a photo of your tea and, in return, delivers a witty, sarcastic verdict. Think of it as the digital sommelier you never knew you needed and probably never wanted.
